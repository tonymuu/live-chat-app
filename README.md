# live-chat-app

## Introduction
1. This is a live instant messaging app that I made as a side project to learn about AngularJS and Socket.io. It is written in AngularJS and using Socket.io.
2. Apparently it is still very crude and needs a lot more work to it. I am planning on go ahead and put more work into it. Pull requests are also welcomed!

## Demo
[Here](http://live-chat-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Todo
1. Add a database to make the message persist (MongoDB).
2. Add registration and login flow (Facebook SDK + Passport.js)
3. Make the app more visully appealling (Bootstrap + sass).
